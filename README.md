How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order for me to create a maintainable, readable, and adaptable program was by using modules. I created a python module to impoprt into project one and two. The python module imported the CRUD documetation that was needed to complete both projects. This module was also the main connection to the mongo database.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I start by looking at all the requirements that are needed to complete the project/assignment. Once I know what is needed I proceed with writing the code that would create the needed functions for the project. If I run into problems, I first do a google search on the problem I'm having. If I still can't find a way to fix the problem, I then would ask for help from someone who knows about this then I do. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist find ways to solve a need and/or problem. If someonw needs a product created or security tested, a computer scienst will work to figure those solutions. I would be able to create reliable code that would help solve those problems. It's a learning process solving these needed problem. Without this learning curve there would be no development in their skills.
